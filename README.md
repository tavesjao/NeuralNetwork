# NeuralNetwork
This repository is dedicted to implementing a Neural Net from scratch using the implementations made in the Deep Learning Spec. course by Andrew Ng.
The intent is to add the implementations as the course goes on, so next steps are adding more optimization options, regularization techniques and ways to deal with overfitting.
